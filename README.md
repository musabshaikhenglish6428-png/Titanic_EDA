# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset to find factors that influenced passenger survival. The goal is to practice **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset
Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Key Steps
1. Data Loading & Inspection
2. Data Cleaning (handling missing values)
3. Feature Engineering (FamilySize)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Visualizations & Insights

## Key Insights
- Women survived more than men.
- 1st class passengers had higher survival rates than 2nd and 3rd class.
- Small families had better survival chances than passengers alone or in very large families.
- Higher fare passengers had better survival.
- Children and young adults had slightly higher survival probability.
